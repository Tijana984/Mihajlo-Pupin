<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called <em>"Pupin coils"</em>, followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist<br>
 and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American<br>
 rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it,<br>
 as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.<br>
 AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance<br>
 telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
